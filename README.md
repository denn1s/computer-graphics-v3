# Computer Graphics with Rust: Framebuffer Lesson

## Introduction

Welcome to the Computer Graphics course with Rust! In this lesson, we'll dive into the fundamental concept of a framebuffer and how to implement it using Rust programming language. We'll be using the `minifb` library for window management and pixel manipulation, and the `nalgebra_glm` library for potential future use with linear algebra operations.

## What is a Framebuffer?

A framebuffer is a data structure that represents the pixels displayed on a computer screen. It holds information about the color and intensity of each pixel on the screen. Think of it as a canvas where you can draw graphics, text, and images.

## Lesson Content
